# Pima_Indians_Diabetes_Database

Hello everyone!

Here I'm Submitting my 2nd project provided by MeriSKILL "Pima Indians Diabetes Database" done using Power BI tool.

📌 This data has originally come from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome.
📌 Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, etc.

# 1. 📁 Data source: 

This dataset is an Excel file which is given by MeriSkill for diabetes data analysis. This includes the data of glucose level, blood pressure level, insulin, pregnancy, skin thickness, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age etc.

# 2. ✔ Motive of this Analysis: 

The motive of this analysis is to diagnostically predict if a patient has or likely to have diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements included in this dataset.

# 3. 🗑 Data Cleaning: 

Although in this dataset none of the columns contain missing values, some of the measurements (Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin and BMI) have values of 0.

# 4. 📊 Visualizations: 

Provided a card for total count, average blood pressure, average diabetes pedigree function, average BMI, average Glucose, and average Insulin. Used Pie chart for diabetic and non-diabetic. Mostly here stacked column chart has been used. Because it's easy to analyze glucose level, blood pressure level, insulin, pregnancy, skin thickness, BMI, and age using bars and for diabetes pedigree function used stacked bar chart by just looking at the height of the bars we can understand easily where sales have increased and decreased.

Number of observations: 768
Number of variables (columns): 9

# 📢 Conclusion:

we plotted a bar plot of all the features used for the predictive analysis with respect to its outcome. And we can see the distribution being favored on the right side when the patient is diabetic. This shows that the higher your age, BMI, insulin, blood pressure, skin thickness, diabetes pedigree, and glucose levels, the higher the chances you are of being diabetic.
